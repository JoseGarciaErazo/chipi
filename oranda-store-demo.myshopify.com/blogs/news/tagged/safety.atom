My own experience with Apple Cider Vinegar is using it to overcome persistent re-flux, particularly if I take medications late in the evening or drink too much alcohol. If you’ve suffered from this condition you will know how uncomfortable it can be once you lie down and try to sleep with the surge of burning acid stomach contents up into your esophagus.It’s worked so well for me that this is what I recommend to friends and family if they are having similar issues. What I’ve also read is that it has many other health benefits. Take a look at a person’s gut and you can tell the overall state of their health… it’s true. Your gut is teeming with bacteria, some good, some bad. These bacteria are often at war with each other – and often evil prevails. The result…inflammation, joint pain, irritable bowel, allergies, skin rashes and more. Apple Cider Vinegar is loaded with beneficial acids that keep bad bacteria in check while building up your army of good bacteria. These acids have powerful antibacterial, antimicrobial and anti-fungal properties that boost your immune system and keep your gut in proper working order.The lychee is unique in that it is the only plant in the genus Litchi of the soapberry family. A native of south China, the lychee is also found in south Vietnam, parts of Indonesia and in the eastern Philippines. The lychee has an outer layer that contains a rough texture and a rind that is pinkish to reddish hue that can be easily removed to get to the inside layer which is edible. The white flesh inside, translucent and sweet, is reminiscent of the flesh of a grape. The brown seed that is shaped like a nut should be thrown out because it can be poisonous.Lychees are usually freshly relished, straight out of the hand. They are normally pitted and peeled, which can be combined with other fruits in fruit salads and fruit cups. Lychees are served stuffed in numerous, delicious combos such as: 1) cottage cheese topped with dressing and pecans, 2) with a combination of mayonnaise and cream cheese or 3) with pecans decorated with whipped-cream. Lychees that are sliced, and then frozen in gelatin (lime), can be presented on top of lettuce with mayonnaise or whip-cream. As a desert, lychees can be placed into layers with ice-cream (pistachio) and used in parfaits with whipped cream. Lychees that have been sliced into halves can be used with the cooking of a ham by placing the halves on the ham the last 45-60 minutes of baking. Lychees that are pureed can be an addition to an ice cream mix. By removing the juice from a seeded lychee, and mixing it with warm milk, sugar, light cream, lemon juice, and plain gelatin you can create sherbet. Sun or fire dried lychees are known as lychee-nuts and taste a bit like a raisin. If ever you have an opportunity to dine in a Vietnamese restaurant, lychees are probably on the drink and dessert menu and this is a wonderful way to experiment with the fruit.Lychees can be a great source for essential vitamins and contains 72 mg of vitamin C. Studies show that it only takes three lychees to meet one-third of an adult’s daily requirement of vitamin C. Lychees can also contain a great amount of copper, potassium and riboflavin.</p>]]>
